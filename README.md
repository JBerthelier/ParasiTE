# Inventory of transposon-related gene isoforms events

In brief, ParasiTE is a new tool aiming to: 

1) identify TEs located in exonic or intronic region of genes
2) detect TEs that are part of gene transcripts and the ones that contribute to alternative isoforms of genes (ATE-G isoforms).

ParasiTE detect candidates for TE-AS and TE-ATP events as illustrate below using [CATANA](https://github.com/shiauck/CATANA) predictions:

# Main steps of ParasiTE

ParasiTE is composed of five main steps:

1) Remove of transcripts of gene-like TEs (transcripts of active TEs which are not involved in gene transcripts)
2) Discrimination of intragenic and intergenic TEs
3) Discrimination of intronic and exonic TEs
4) Detection of TE-gene (TE-G) transcripts events
5) Detection of alternative TE-gene (ATE-G) isoform events

2) gene annotation in .gff/.gtf
3) de novo transcriptome annotation in .gtf file generated by Stringtie2 (version 2.1.4 was used) (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)
or a gff/gtf file that have the same structure than files generated by Stringtie2 (see below Table 1).
4) [OPTIONAL] a gene-like transcript of TE annotation (transcripts of active TEs) such as the one of [Panda et al. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/32/9/2687/6115671?login=true) for A. thaliana

# Outputs

Results are in "ParasiTE_output" directory:

- Annotation of intergenic and intragenic TEs.
- Among Intragenic TEs, the annotation of intragenic (intronic and exonic) TEs.
- List of TE-genes candidates
- List of ATE-G isoforms candidates

# Run Parasite demo data to test your installation

Expected run time for demo data is 2 min (it was tested on a Linux Machine Ubuntu with 8Gb of memory)  

1. extract the folder
`cd /ParasiTE/`

`tar -xvzf Demo_data_Araport11.tar.gz`

2. run the command

`Rscript /Fullpathway/ParasiTE/ParasiTE_v1/ParasiTE.R -T /Fullpathway/ParasiTE/Demo_data_Araport11/TEs_urgi_tair10.min200.gff3 -R /Fullpathway/ParasiTE/Demo_data_Araport11/Athaliana_447_Araport11.transcript_exons.for_ParasiTE_SC.gtf -G /Fullpathway/ParasiTE/Demo_data_Araport11/Athaliana_447_Araport11.gene.gff3 -L /Fullpathway/ParasiTE/Demo_data_Araport11/TAIR10-Panda_cat_TE_gene-like.gff3 -P SC`

**/Fullpathway/** has to be replaced by your data pathway

If the script finished without errors and you get files in five output diresctories (STEP1 to STEP5) in ParasiTE_output/Results your installation is well done.

# Run your data with ParasiTE (please read until the end)

**The basic command is:**

`Rscript /Fullpathway/ParasiTE/ParasiTE_v1/ParasiTE.R -T /Fullpathway/TE_annotation.gff3 -G /Fullpathway/gene_annotation.gtf 
-R /Fullpathway/transcripts_annotation.gtf -L /Fullpathway/gene-like_TE_annotation.gff3 -P {mode}`

**ParasiTE was built to work with Stringtie2 de novo transcriptome (but can use custom transcriptomes see how to use it below).** 

We choose [Stringtie2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/), because it allows to identify chimeric transcript such as altTE-Gi.
Moreover. Stringtie2 supports short reads (eg. Illumina) or long reads (eg. PacBio or Oxford Nanopore).

**For the -P {mode}**

1) Transcriptomes obtained with Stringtie2 from long reads alignment

- If the transcriptome was obtained with Stringtie2 with the -L mode you must use `-P SL`   

- If the transcriptome was obtained with Stringtie2 with the -R mode you must use `-P SR`  

2) Transcriptome annotation obtained with Stringtie2 from short reads alignment
 you must use `-P SL`  

3) Transcriptome obtained by stringtie2 Merge option or custom transcriptome following the same format as Stringtie2
you must use `-P SA`   

4) Custom transcriptome following the structure dysplayed below (such as "/Demo_data/Athaliana_447_Araport11.transcript_exons.for_ParasiTE.gtf" )
you must use `-P SC`

**Input data structure**

For gene annotation, transcriptome annotation, TE annotation and gene-like TE annotation, the seqname must be numerique (no "Chr1" but 1, no "Mit" but a number) (see Table 1) 

**Transcriptome annotation**

ParasiTE was developed to work with Stringtie2 structure transcriptome (see Table 1)
However, for some transcriptome annotation, the exon numbering is different than Stringtie2.

![](https://github.com/JBerthelier/ParasiTE/blob/master/Help_numbering.png)

For any custom transcriptome (SC or SA) the attribute must be like below:

Table 1:

|seqname|source|feature   |start |end  |score|strand|frame|attribute                                                  |
|------:|-----:|---------:|-----:|----:|----:|-----:|----:|----------------------------------------------------------:|
|1      |Ref   |transcript|6788  |9130 |1000 | +    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.1";                    |
|1      |Ref   |exon      |6788  |7069 |1000 | .    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.1"; exon_number_id "1";|
|1      |Ref   |exon      |8571  |9130 |1000 | .    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.1"; exon_number_id "2";|
|1      |Ref   |transcript|3631  |5899 |1000 | +    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.2";                    |
|1      |Ref   |exon      |6788  |7069 |1000 | .    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.2"; exon_number_id "1";|
|1      |Ref   |exon      |7157  |7450 |1000 | .    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.2"; exon_number_id "2";|
|1      |Ref   |exon      |8571  |8737 |1000 | .    | .   |gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.2"; exon_number_id "3";|
|1      |Ref   |transcript|3631  |5899 |1000 | +    | .   |gene_id "ID.2"; transcript_id "ID.2.1";                    |
|1      |Ref   |exon      |6788  |7069 |1000 | .    | .   |gene_id "ID.2"; transcript_id "ID.2.1"; exon_number_id "1";|
etc...

*Be careful* 
- "seqname" must be a **number** has showed in table (no characters allowed, in example "1" corresponds to "chromosome 1").

-"Attribute" must followed the correct format as displayed.

-for transcript:  gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.1"; ("ÏD" can be any other word, such as GENE.1, transcript_id "GENE.1.1")

-for exon: gene_id "ID.1"; transcript_id "ID.1.1"; exon_number_id "1";

Otherwise ParasiTE will not works properly

**TE annotation**

We used the following structure for TE annotation, you need to provide a "ID=theTEid" in the attribute (see example in Table 2)

Table 2:
|seqname|source|feature   |start |end  |score|strand|frame|attribute                                                     |
|------:|-----:|---------:|-----:|----:|----:|-----:|----:|-------------------------------------------------------------:|
|1      |Ref   |TE        |17024 |18924|.    | .    | .   |ID=AT1TE00025;Number=594947;super_family=DHX;family=ATREP3    |
|1      |Ref   |TE        |18331 |18642|.    | .    | .   |ID=AT1TE00030;Number=597081;super_family=DTA;family=ATHATN7   |
|1      |Ref   |TE        |55676 |56576|.    | .    | .   |ID=AT1TE00150;Number=592885;super_family=DTA;family=SIMPLEHAT1|
